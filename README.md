Learning Full-Stack JavaScript Development: MongoDB, Node, and React

 My progress in the Lynda.com course.  Goal is to use what I learn here in my UMLeto project.
 
## Origional authors source repo
github.com:jscomplete/learn-fullstack-javascript.git

Removed it as a submodule to this project due to its age.  Many things have changed with newer versions of the dependancies and such.  I have written everything you see here following the videos, I've made modifications to make it work in 2018.

Work in progress, currently at **API to fetch a list of names**
